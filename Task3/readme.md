# ATM Interface Project

## Overview

This project simulates an ATM interface allowing users to perform transactions such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance. It is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. The ATM connects to a `BankAccount` class, allowing modifications to the account balance and ensuring proper validation for user inputs.
